# CRUD-MVC-OOP-PHP

This is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** system built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern in **PHP**.

I developed this project during my **2nd year in college** as a **self-initiated learning activity**. I created it by sitting in another classroom session, outside of my official section, to learn and apply foundational concepts in backend web development.

This project reflects my personal initiative and commitment to improving my programming skills beyond my formal coursework.
